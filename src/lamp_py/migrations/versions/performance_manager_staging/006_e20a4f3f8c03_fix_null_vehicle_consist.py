Create Date: 2024-03-07 15:44:22.989929

On March 5th 2024, the vehicle consist field was removed from the VehiclePositions GTFS-RT feed
this broke our data pipeline requiring a switch to the multi_carriage_details field
this migration should re-process our realtime data from March 5th to present to fix missing
vehicle consist values
